  <p class="hidden">Heavy Rain Triggers Severe Flooding in Shaanxi Province</p>
  <p class="hidden">Unprecedented rainfall has unleashed devastating floods across Shaanxi Province since July 16, severely affecting over 21 million people. Cities including Baoji, Shangluo, and Xi’an reported record-breaking precipitation, with Jintai District receiving 226.3 mm in a single day—the highest ever recorded in the area.</p>
  <p class="hidden">The flooding paralyzed transportation, submerging highways and disrupting rail services, including key sections of the Baocheng Railway. Power outages left thousands of households without electricity, while overwhelmed drainage systems caused widespread urban flooding in low-lying areas.</p>
  <p class="hidden">Local authorities evacuated tens of thousands of residents to temporary shelters, ensuring basic supplies such as food, drinking water, and medical care. Preliminary assessments indicated direct economic losses exceeding 17 billion yuan, with extensive damage to agricultural land, infrastructure, and housing.</p>
  <p class="hidden">Scientists attribute the disaster to abnormal monsoon activity and Shaanxi’s complex topography. Experts call for enhanced flood prevention infrastructure and improved urban drainage systems to mitigate future risks.</p>
